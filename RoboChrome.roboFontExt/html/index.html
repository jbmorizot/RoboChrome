		<h1>RoboChrome</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>RoboChrome is a RoboFont extension that allows to edit and generate fonts
			with colored glyphs.</p>
		<p>There are different proposals for how colored glyphs can be stored in a
			font. RoboChrome’s model is based on the <strong>Microsoft
			proposal,</strong> which allows a black-and-white glyph to be replaced by a
			sequence of layered colorized glyphs. That means every layer corresponds to
			one color. Gradients are not possible. The fonts remain small since the
			space requirement of a colored glyph is about the same of a normal
			black-and-white glyph.</p>
		<p>The layered glyphs are rasterized to PNG images when you choose to export
			a font in the <strong>Apple color font format.</strong> These fonts are slow
			to generate and will take up considerably more space.</p>
		<p>The <strong>Adobe/Mozilla proposal</strong> allows SVG documents to be
			stored as glyphs in a font. In RoboChrome, the SVG document is always
			derived from the sequence of glyph layers, though native SVGs allow much
			more flexibility, e. g. gradients, animation, and bitmap images.</p>
		<p>The bitmap-based <strong>Google proposal</strong> is not supported in
			RoboChrome at the moment.</p>
